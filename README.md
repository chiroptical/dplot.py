dplot.py
========

Here is a `dplot` block generator for [NWChem](http://www.nwchem-sw.org/index.php/Main_Page).
The input is pretty self explanatory, try the `--help` option. You will need access to
[docopt](https://github.com/docopt/docopt) python package. The `docopt` script
is amazing, check it out! Or, just install it with your favorite python PyPI installer.
